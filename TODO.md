# Todo list

## Present

### Search
- Futility pruning
- Razoring (maybe can skip?)
- Delta pruning (maybe can skip?)
- Static Exchange Evaluation
    - SEE move ordering
    - SEE pruning in quiesce
    - SEE pruning in search
- Continuation history
- Staged movegen
- History pruning (maybe)
- Doing reductions for captures

### Evaluation
- Mopup?
- Passed pawns + pawn structure (might skip for NNUE)
- Evaluation tuning (might skip for NNUE)

### Misc
- Get windows working so we can get CCRL rated
- Get an openbench workflow working with maybe gcloud

## Far Future
- Rethinking the hash replacement scheme
- NNUE (maybe once we hit 2800?)
- Null move research
- Improving heuristic
- Probcut
- Capture history
- Search tuning w/ SPSA
- Correction history
